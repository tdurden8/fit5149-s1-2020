    "1. The **residual vs fitted plot**: This plot is used to check the linear assumption. It shows if residuals have non-linear patterns. If you find equally spread residuals around a horizontal line without distinct patterns, that is a good indication you have linear relationships. However, if the relationship between predictors and an response variable is non-linear, an obvious pattern could show up in this plot if the model cannot capture the non-linearity. The first plot above shows that there could be a non-linear relationship between <font color='orange'>mpg </font>and all the predictors, as the residuals are not scattered evenly.\n",
    "* The normal **Q-Q plot**: The Q-Q plot (i.e., quantile-quantile plot) is a graphical tool to help us assess if a set of data plausibly came from some theoretical distribution such as a Normal. For example, if we run a statistical analysis that assumes our dependent variable is Normally distributed, we can use a Normal Q-Q plot to check that assumption. In the case of linear regression analysis, we assume that residual is normally distributed with constant variance and mean equal to zero. The normal Q-Q plot shows if residuals are normally distributed. Do residuals follow a straight line well or do they deviate severely? It is good if residuals are lined well on the straight dashed line.  What do you think about the normal Q-Q plot above? Of course it cannot be a perfect straight line and this will be your call. it seems that the residuals are distributed normally. \n",
    "* The **scale-location plot**: It is used to check the assumption of equal variance by showing if residuals are spread equally along the ranges of predictors. It is good if we can see a horizontal line with equally (randomly) spread points. The scale-location plot shows that the residuals appear randomly spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **residual-leverage plot**: it helps us identify influential data samples. Not all outliers are influential in linear regression analysis. Here we care about the samples that are influential to determine the regression line. These samples can very influential even if they look to be within a reasonable range of the values. They can alter the results if we exclude them from analysis. In the residual-leverage plot, we look for outlying values at the upper right corner or at the lower right corner. Samples located in those places can be influential against a regression line. How do we identify those samples? We usually use Cook’s distance, indicated by a red dash line. When samples are outside of the Cook’s distance (i.e, they have high Cook’s distance scores, Cook’s distance measures how much the entire regression function changes when the i-th case is deleted.), the samples are influential to the regression results. The regression results will be altered if we exclude those samples. The fourth plot shows some outliers, such as 14. However, we can barely see Cook’s distance lines because all cases are well inside of the Cook’s distance lines. Therefore no influential cases are observed."
